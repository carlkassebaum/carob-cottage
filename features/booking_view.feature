Feature: Booking View
  As an administrator,
  So that I can view and check the details of a booking,
  I want to be able to view and edit all details of a booking.
  
  Background:

  Scenario: Click on and view booking
    Given I log in as an administrator with "bob@outlook.com" and "foo_bar"
    And it is currently June 29, 2018
    When I am on the administration booking manager page
    And I click on the "Booking" for the dates "20-1-2018" to "25-1-2018"
    Then I should see the following booking details:
