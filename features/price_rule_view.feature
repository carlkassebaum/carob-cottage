Feature: Price Rule View
  As an administrator,
  So that I can identify quickly if a price rule requires correction or change
  I want to be able to view all price rules in the system as a list.
  
  Background: 
    Given the following administrators exist:
      | name | email_address   | password | password_confirmation |
      | bob  | bob@outlook.com | foo_bar  | foo_bar               |
    And I log in as an administrator with "bob@outlook.com" and "foo_bar"  
  
  Scenario: No price rules
    Given I am on the administration page
    And I press "Price Manager"
    Then I should see "There are currently no price rules!"
